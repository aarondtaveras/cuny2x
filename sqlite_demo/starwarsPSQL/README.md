- Select all the SITH (red lightsabers from jedis) You should be returned:
        
        name
        ------------------
        Dmitry Binks
        Justinbacca
        Kevin Windu
        Yasmeen-the-Hutt
        Sith Lord Daniel
        Henry Kenobi
        Nader Skywalker
        
- There was an assasination by the Sith! All the green lightsaber owners need to be deleted from the records! You should be returned:

        DELETE 5    
    
- SELECT * FROM jedis, you should see the green lightsaber owners missing.  
    
- A New Jedi emerges. Add "The unknown" with a "black" lightsaber who has 100 years training, never tempted by the dark side

- When you select all from jedis, you should notice a new jedi:

        | the unknown | black | 100 | f                    

- The new Jedi trains all of the blue light saber owners. They dobule their years_training instantly. This command should return: 
        
        UPDATE 5    

- The orange lightsaber owners attack the unknown in the night. Ultimate fail. Remove the orange lightsaber owners. This command should return: 
        
        DELETE 2
    
- Concerned, The new Jedi converts the brown and purple lightsaber owners to blue, and doubles their training also... The output should be:

        UPDATE 5
        
- The ultimate Jedi battle takes place. Sadly, all novice Jedi (good and bad) with < 20 years_training need to be deleted from our records. Output should be: 

        DELETE 15

- The unknown one vanishes. Remove them from the records. 

- Who are the last standing Jedis?
