# cuny2x
Aaron Taveras' portfolio for the CUNY 2x bootcamp/TTL pipeline. 

This repo started as my official application for the CUNY 2x program. 

Since then, I've been accepted into the program and have begun a month long coding bootcamp to sharpen my skills for
the internship which I have been matched with.

Skills included will be: HTML, CSS, JavaScript (basic scripting, OO-design, React, Node, and Express), and MongoDB. 

I will be posting each assignment on GitHub with documentation to show my personal approaches to solving them, and to
date my work for both review purposes and professional purposes. 

Enjoy!
